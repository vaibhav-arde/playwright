    "To install Node.js, follow these steps based on your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Installing Node.js on Windows**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 1**: Download the Node.js installer from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).\n",
    "     - Choose the recommended LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Step 2**: Run the installer.\n",

    "   - **Step 3**: Verify the installation.\n",
    "     - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.\n",
    "     - Run the following commands to check the installation and versions:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. **Using nvm (Node Version Manager)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you want to manage multiple versions of Node.js, you can use `nvm`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Install nvm**:\n",
    "     - Run this command in Terminal (macOS and Linux) or install [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).\n",
    "       ```bash\n",
    "       curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash\n",
    "       source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc, depending on your shell\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Install Node.js with nvm**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     nvm install 18  # installs Node.js version 18\n",
    "     nvm use 18      # switches to Node.js version 18\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Verify Installation**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     node -v\n",
    "     npm -v\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "After following the installation steps, `node -v` and `npm -v` should display the installed versions, confirming that Node.js and npm are correctly installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have `.zshrc` as your shell configuration file, you can adjust the command like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash\n",
    "source ~/.zshrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `source ~/.zshrc` command ensures that `nvm` is loaded into your current shell session by reloading the `.zshrc` file, where `nvm` is typically added upon installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This should make `nvm` immediately available for use without needing to restart your terminal.\n",
