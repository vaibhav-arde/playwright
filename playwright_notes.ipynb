    "### 4. **Using nvm (Node Version Manager)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you want to manage multiple versions of Node.js, you can use `nvm`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Install nvm**:\n",
    "     - Run this command in Terminal (macOS and Linux) or install [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).\n",
    "       ```bash\n",
    "       curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash\n",

    "source ~/.zshrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `source ~/.zshrc` command ensures that `nvm` is loaded into your current shell session by reloading the `.zshrc` file, where `nvm` is typically added upon installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This should make `nvm` immediately available for use without needing to restart your terminal.\n",

    "## **Fixtures in Playwright**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Playwright, **fixtures** are a foundational concept that helps manage the setup and teardown of state for your tests. Fixtures can be used to create reusable test environments, such as setting up a browser context, a page, or specific test data, before the tests run. They simplify the test code by eliminating repetitive setup/teardown logic and enable you to control dependencies, which makes tests more maintainable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **What Are Fixtures in Playwright?**\n",
    "Fixtures are objects or states that you need in every test, such as a browser instance or a page object. They handle the setup and teardown needed before and after the tests. In Playwright, fixtures are usually set up using the `test` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Playwright Test Fixtures**\n",
    "Playwright’s `@playwright/test` library provides several built-in fixtures that you can use out of the box. Here are some common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `browser`: Launches a new browser instance.\n",
    "   - `context`: Creates a browser context (similar to an incognito window).\n",
    "   - `page`: Creates a new page within a browser context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playwright manages these built-in fixtures automatically, so you don’t need to configure them manually unless you want custom behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Using Built-in Fixtures**\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a fixture in your tests, import `test` and `expect` from `@playwright/test`. The `test` function provides the fixtures you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// example.spec.js\n",
    "import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n",
    "\n",
    "test('basic test with page fixture', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n",
    "  const title = await page.title();\n",
    "  expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `{ page }` fixture is automatically provided to the test by Playwright.\n",
    "- The test navigates to a webpage and verifies its title.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Custom Fixtures**\n",
    "If you need custom fixtures, you can define them using the `test.extend` method. This is useful for setting up database connections, authentication, or any custom resources your tests require.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Creating a Custom Fixture\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how to set up a custom fixture for an authenticated state:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import { test as baseTest } from '@playwright/test';\n",
    "\n",
    "// Extend the base test with a custom fixture\n",
    "const test = baseTest.extend({\n",
    "  authPage: async ({ page }, use) => {\n",
    "    // Perform login actions\n",
    "    await page.goto('https://example.com/login');\n",
    "    await page.fill('#username', 'testuser');\n",
    "    await page.fill('#password', 'password');\n",
    "    await page.click('button[type=\"submit\"]');\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Wait for navigation or other indication of a successful login\n",
    "    await page.waitForSelector('text=Welcome');\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Pass the authenticated page to the test\n",
    "    await use(page);\n",
    "  },\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "export { test };\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage of the custom `authPage` fixture in a test\n",
    "test('test with custom authPage fixture', async ({ authPage }) => {\n",
    "  await authPage.goto('https://example.com/dashboard');\n",
    "  const welcomeText = await authPage.textContent('h1');\n",
    "  expect(welcomeText).toBe('Welcome to Your Dashboard');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `authPage` is a custom fixture that provides a logged-in page.\n",
    "- `await use(page);` tells Playwright to clean up this fixture after the test completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Managing Fixture Scope**\n",
    "Fixtures can have different scopes:\n",
    "   - `test`: The fixture is created and torn down with each test. This is the default.\n",
    "   - `worker`: The fixture is created once per worker, which can reduce setup time in large test suites.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify the scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const test = baseTest.extend({\n",
    "  database: [async ({}, use) => {\n",
    "    const db = await setupDatabase();\n",
    "    await use(db);\n",
    "    await db.teardown();\n",
    "  }, { scope: 'worker' }]\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example makes `database` a `worker` scoped fixture, initializing it once per worker thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Teardown for Fixtures**\n",
    "Playwright handles teardown automatically, but if you have custom setup that needs cleanup, use the `use` function to add teardown logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "With these steps, you can use and create custom fixtures to manage state across your tests, making your Playwright tests more efficient and maintainable. Let me know if you'd like more details on any specific part of using fixtures in Playwright!\n",
    "\n",

    "## **playwright.config.js**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `playwright.config.js` file is where you define the configuration for running Playwright tests. It allows you to specify global settings, customize browser behaviors, define projects, and even use hooks to set up and tear down test environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Aspects of `playwright.config.js`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Configuration**:\n",
    "   The `playwright.config.js` file exports a configuration object (or function). This configuration controls various aspects of how Playwright tests are run.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Structure**:\n",
    "   The configuration file is typically structured with properties such as:\n",
    "   - **testDir**: The directory containing your tests.\n",
    "   - **timeout**: Global timeout for tests.\n",
    "   - **use**: Common configuration that is applied across all tests (e.g., browser settings, headless mode).\n",
    "   - **projects**: Defines configurations for different projects or browsers (e.g., running tests on Chrome, Firefox, and Webkit).\n",
    "   - **reporter**: Defines the test result reporters (e.g., `list`, `json`, `html`).\n",
    "   - **globalSetup**, **globalTeardown**: Global setup and teardown scripts.\n",
    "   - **workers**: Number of test workers used for parallel execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Configuration (`playwright.config.js`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of a basic `playwright.config.js` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// playwright.config.js\n",
    "const { defineConfig } = require('@playwright/test');\n",
    "\n",

    "  retries: 2, // Number of retries for failed tests\n",
    "  use: {\n",
    "    headless: true, // Run tests in headless mode (default: true)\n",
    "    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 }, // Set viewport size\n",
    "    video: 'on-first-retry', // Capture video on first retry\n",
    "    screenshot: 'only-on-failure', // Take screenshot only if the test fails\n",
    "    baseURL: 'http://example.com', // Base URL for relative URLs\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  projects: [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      name: 'firefox',\n",
    "      use: { browserName: 'firefox' },\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      name: 'webkit',\n",
    "      use: { browserName: 'webkit' },\n",
    "    },\n",
    "  ],\n",
    "  reporter: [\n",
    "    ['list'], // Output the results in the terminal\n",
    "    ['html', { outputFolder: 'test-results', open: 'always' }], // Generate HTML reports\n",
    "  ],\n",
    "  globalSetup: './global-setup.js', // Run before tests start\n",
    "  globalTeardown: './global-teardown.js', // Run after all tests finish\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **testDir**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Specifies the directory that contains your test files.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `testDir: './tests'` means your tests are located in the `tests` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **timeout**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Sets the global timeout for each test (in milliseconds).\n",
    "   - **Example**: `timeout: 30000` means each test will time out after 30 seconds if it doesn't finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **use**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: This is an object where you define settings that should be applied to all tests in the configuration.\n",
    "   - **Options**:\n",
    "     - **headless**: Whether to run tests in headless mode (no browser UI). Default is `true`.\n",
    "     - **viewport**: Set the size of the browser window for the tests.\n",
    "     - **video**: Capture video of the test execution (e.g., `on-first-retry`, `always`, `off`).\n",
    "     - **screenshot**: Automatically take a screenshot on test failure (or other conditions).\n",
    "     - **baseURL**: Set a base URL to resolve relative URLs in tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **projects**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Allows you to run tests across multiple browser configurations, or even different test environments.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Define separate configurations for running tests on `firefox`, `webkit`, or other browser engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **reporter**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Specifies how test results are reported.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `['list']` outputs the results in the terminal, and `['html', { outputFolder: 'test-results' }]` generates an HTML report saved to the `test-results` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **globalSetup** and **globalTeardown**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Scripts that run before and after all tests, respectively.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **globalSetup** could be used to perform tasks like setting up a test database or starting a server before any tests run.\n",
    "     - **globalTeardown** could be used to clean up after all tests, such as shutting down the server or cleaning up test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **retries**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Specifies how many times to retry a failed test.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `retries: 2` will retry a failing test 2 times before marking it as failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **workers**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Defines the number of workers to run tests in parallel.\n",
    "   - **Example**: You can increase the number of workers for faster execution in large test suites.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. **use (with specific settings per browser)**\n",
    "   - You can define **browser-specific** settings within the `projects` array. For example, to run tests with different settings in each browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "projects: [\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    name: 'chromium',\n",
    "    use: { browserName: 'chromium', headless: false, viewport: { width: 1280, height: 800 } },\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    name: 'firefox',\n",
    "    use: { browserName: 'firefox' },\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    name: 'webkit',\n",
    "    use: { browserName: 'webkit' },\n",
    "  },\n",
    "],\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Example with Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use environment variables to handle different environments for testing, such as testing against a staging server or using different credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "module.exports = defineConfig({\n",
    "  use: {\n",
    "    baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000', // Use BASE_URL from environment variable or fallback to localhost\n",
    "  },\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The `playwright.config.js` file is where you define your global configuration for Playwright tests. It lets you manage settings such as timeouts, retries, browser configurations, and environment setup. You can customize it to meet the needs of your testing environment, whether you're testing on multiple browsers, defining reusable settings, or managing complex setups with global hooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In Playwright, `config` and `defineConfig` are both used in the `playwright.config.js` (or `playwright.config.ts` if you're using TypeScript) to configure and define your testing setup. The main difference lies in how they are used and how Playwright processes them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`config` (Traditional Object Export)**\n",
    "Previously (before Playwright 1.17), you would typically export a configuration using the `config` object directly. This is the older style of defining the Playwright test configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// playwright.config.js\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  testDir: './tests',\n",
    "  timeout: 30000,\n",
    "  use: {\n",
    "    headless: true,\n",
    "    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },\n",
    "  },\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- You export a plain JavaScript object.\n",
    "- This works well in most cases but can be less flexible when dealing with more complex configurations, especially with TypeScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`defineConfig` (Recommended for TypeScript and Better IntelliSense)**\n",
    "The `defineConfig` function is a more modern way of defining your Playwright configuration and is recommended for better support, especially if you're using TypeScript. It provides improved TypeScript type inference, better IntelliSense, and a more explicit way of defining the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// playwright.config.js\n",
    "const { defineConfig } = require('@playwright/test');\n",
    "\n",
    "module.exports = defineConfig({\n",
    "  testDir: './tests',\n",
    "  timeout: 30000,\n",
    "  use: {\n",
    "    headless: true,\n",
    "    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },\n",
    "  },\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- `defineConfig` is a helper function that Playwright uses to improve configuration handling.\n",
    "- It ensures type safety in TypeScript (if used) and provides better IntelliSense in IDEs.\n",
    "- The `defineConfig` function also allows for more complex configuration setups, as it can handle more advanced TypeScript and JavaScript use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Between `config` and `defineConfig`:\n",

    "- **Use `defineConfig`** if you’re using TypeScript or want enhanced IDE support and better configuration management.\n",
    "- **Use `config`** if you're working with simple JavaScript configurations and don't need the additional features that `defineConfig` offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with Advanced Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `defineConfig` can help manage more complex scenarios, such as conditional configuration based on environment variables or adding hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// playwright.config.js\n",
    "const { defineConfig } = require('@playwright/test');\n",
    "\n",
    "module.exports = defineConfig({\n",
    "  testDir: './tests',\n",
    "  timeout: 30000,\n",
    "  use: {\n",
    "    headless: true,\n",
    "    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  projects: [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      name: 'firefox',\n",
    "      use: { browserName: 'firefox' },\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      name: 'webkit',\n",
    "      use: { browserName: 'webkit' },\n",
    "    },\n",
    "  ],\n",
    "  // Setup hooks\n",
    "  globalSetup: './global-setup.js',\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, **`defineConfig`** is the more modern and flexible approach, especially when using TypeScript, providing better developer support and future-proofing your configuration, while **`config`** is the simpler, older method that works fine for straightforward setups."

    "## **Test Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Playwright by default tests will run in headless mode. `npx playwright test`\n",
    "- Headed Mode : `npx playwright test --headed`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To run tests in Playwright, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Install Playwright**:\n",
    "Before you can run tests, you need to install Playwright in your project. If you haven't done so already, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm init -y  # Initialize a new project (if you haven't already)\n",
    "npm install @playwright/test --save-dev  # Install Playwright testing package\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install Playwright and the test runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Create Test Files**:\n",
    "Create a test file in your project directory. Playwright tests are typically placed in a `tests` or `e2e` folder, but the structure can vary. A simple test file looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// tests/example.spec.js\n",
    "const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');\n",
    "\n",
    "test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n",
    "  const title = await page.title();\n",
    "  expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `test()` is used to define a test.\n",
    "- `expect()` is used to make assertions, such as checking the page title.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Run the Tests**:\n",
    "After writing your tests, you can run them using the Playwright Test Runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run all the tests in your project, simply use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx playwright test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will:\n",
    "- Look for all `.spec.js` or `.test.js` files by default.\n",
    "- Execute the tests in headless mode (without opening the browser UI).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Run Specific Tests**:\n",
    "You can run a specific test file or a test within a file. For example, to run a specific test file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or to run tests by name, you can use a pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx playwright test -g \"basic test\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will only run tests with the name \"basic test.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Run Tests in Different Browsers**:\n",
    "You can specify which browser to use for the tests. Playwright supports `chromium`, `firefox`, and `webkit`. You can set this in the test configuration, or run tests with a specific browser using the `--project` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx playwright test --project=firefox\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can specify browsers in the `playwright.config.js` file under the `projects` section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Run Tests in Parallel**:\n",
    "Playwright runs tests in parallel by default. If you want to configure the number of workers (parallel processes), you can set this in the configuration file (`playwright.config.js`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// playwright.config.js\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  workers: 4, // Use 4 parallel workers\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or specify the number of workers via the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx playwright test --workers=4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Running Tests in Headless or Headed Mode**:\n",
    "By default, Playwright runs tests in headless mode. If you want to see the browser while running the tests (headed mode), you can override this in the `use` configuration in `playwright.config.js`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// playwright.config.js\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  use: {\n",
    "    headless: false,  // Run in headed mode\n",
    "  },\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or use the command line to set the mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx playwright test --headed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **View the Test Results**:\n",
    "After running the tests, Playwright provides detailed output in the terminal by default. If you want more detailed results or a report, you can configure reporters in the `playwright.config.js` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// playwright.config.js\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  reporter: [['list'], ['html', { outputFolder: 'test-results' }]],\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will generate a detailed HTML report in the `test-results` folder, which you can open in a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Run Tests with Environment Variables**:\n",
    "If your tests need environment variables (e.g., for authentication), you can set them like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "BASE_URL=https://example.com npx playwright test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use them in the `playwright.config.js`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  use: {\n",
    "    baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',\n",
    "  },\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Running Tests with Debugging**:\n",
    "If you need to debug your tests, Playwright provides several debugging options, such as `--debug`, which will allow you to inspect the browser's state during the test:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx playwright test --debug\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This opens Playwright's inspector tool, where you can inspect the current state of the browser, interact with it, and troubleshoot your test failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Run Tests with Browser Context**:\n",
    "You can also define a browser context in your tests. Playwright allows for multiple isolated browser contexts to be run in a single browser instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with context:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');\n",
    "\n",
    "test('browser context test', async ({ browser }) => {\n",
    "  const context = await browser.newContext();\n",
    "  const page = await context.newPage();\n",
    "  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n",
    "  const title = await page.title();\n",
    "  expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps in testing things like multi-user scenarios or ensuring clean state for each test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Test Reporters**:\n",
    "Playwright supports various test reporters to customize the output of the test results. Some popular options include:\n",
    "- `list`: Outputs results in a compact format.\n",
    "- `html`: Generates an HTML report of the test results.\n",
    "- `json`: Outputs results in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use reporters, update your `playwright.config.js` like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  reporter: [['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }], ['json']],\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Running tests in Playwright is easy once the setup is complete. You can execute tests in different browsers, headless or headed modes, with parallel execution, and use advanced features like environment variables, debugging, and custom reporters for better visibility.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **Execute tests using special test options**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Playwright, you can control which tests are executed using special test options like `.only`, `.skip`, and `.describe.only`. These options are helpful for narrowing down the test execution, debugging, or skipping tests during specific situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`test.only`**:\n",
    "The `test.only` option is used to run only a specific test or set of tests while skipping all others. This is especially useful when you want to focus on one particular test for debugging or development purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');\n",
    "\n",
    "test('first test', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n",
    "  const title = await page.title();\n",
    "  expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "test.only('second test', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');\n",
    "  const title = await page.title();\n",
    "  expect(title).toBe('Playwright');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, only the \"second test\" will run, and the \"first test\" will be skipped. The `.only` modifier is applied to the second test, meaning only that test will be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`test.skip`**:\n",
    "The `test.skip` option is used to skip a specific test. This can be helpful when a test is temporarily failing or under development, and you don't want it to block the test suite execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');\n",
    "\n",
    "test('first test', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n",
    "  const title = await page.title();\n",
    "  expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "test.skip('second test', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');\n",
    "  const title = await page.title();\n",
    "  expect(title).toBe('Playwright');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the second test will be skipped, and only the \"first test\" will run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **`describe.only`**:\n",
    "Similar to `test.only`, the `describe.only` option is used to run only the tests in a specific `describe` block. You can use this when you want to focus on a group of related tests while skipping others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const { test, expect, describe } = require('@playwright/test');\n",
    "\n",
    "describe('group of tests', () => {\n",
    "  test('first test', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "    await page.goto('https://example.com');\n",
    "    const title = await page.title();\n",
    "    expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');\n",
    "  });\n",
    "\n",
    "  test('second test', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "    await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');\n",
    "    const title = await page.title();\n",
    "    expect(title).toBe('Playwright');\n",
    "  });\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "describe.only('group of focused tests', () => {\n",
    "  test('third test', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "    await page.goto('https://github.com');\n",
    "    const title = await page.title();\n",
    "    expect(title).toBe('GitHub');\n",
    "  });\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, only the tests within `describe.only('group of focused tests')` will run, and the tests in the first `describe` block will be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **`test.todo`**:\n",
    "The `test.todo` option allows you to mark tests as \"to-do\". These tests are not executed, but they serve as reminders to implement the test logic later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const { test } = require('@playwright/test');\n",
    "\n",
    "test.todo('write a test for the login page');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `test.todo` marks the test as a placeholder, and it will appear in the test output with a \"pending\" status. You can then come back and implement the test logic later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **`test.concurrent`**:\n",
    "The `test.concurrent` option allows you to run multiple tests concurrently. By default, Playwright runs tests sequentially, but you can opt to run tests concurrently using this modifier. This is especially useful for running independent tests in parallel to speed up test execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');\n",
    "\n",
    "test.concurrent('test 1', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n",
    "  const title = await page.title();\n",
    "  expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "test.concurrent('test 2', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');\n",
    "  const title = await page.title();\n",
    "  expect(title).toBe('Playwright');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will run both tests concurrently instead of sequentially, which can save time in cases where tests don't rely on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Options:\n",
    "- **`.only`**: Runs only the specific test or group of tests (`describe.only`).\n",
    "- **`.skip`**: Skips the specific test or group of tests.\n",
    "- **`describe.only`**: Runs only the tests inside a specific `describe` block.\n",
    "- **`test.todo`**: Marks a test as \"to-do\" to be implemented later.\n",
    "- **`test.concurrent`**: Runs tests concurrently, in parallel, to speed up test execution.\n",

    "## **Run tests in a headed browser**\n",
    "\n",
    "To run tests in a **headed** browser (where you can visually see the browser while tests are running) instead of the default **headless** mode (where the browser runs in the background), you need to modify the `playwright.config.js` configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Modify `playwright.config.js` for Headed Mode**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify that the browser should run in headed mode by setting the `headless` option to `false` under the `use` property in the configuration file. The `use` property allows you to configure settings for the browsers that Playwright uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example `playwright.config.js`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// playwright.config.js\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  use: {\n",
    "    headless: false,  // Set this to false to run the browser in headed mode\n",
    "    // You can also set other browser configurations like viewport, locale, etc.\n",
    "  },\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Specify Browser for Headed Mode (Optional)**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify which browser to use (Chromium, Firefox, Webkit) by setting the `browserName` property under the `projects` or `use` section. This step is optional because Playwright defaults to Chromium, but it is helpful if you want to test with a specific browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example to set the browser to **Chromium**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// playwright.config.js\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  use: {\n",
    "    headless: false,     // Run the browser in headed mode\n",
    "    browserName: 'chromium',  // Optional: specify which browser to use\n",
    "  },\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Run Tests in Headed Mode via Command Line**\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also run tests in **headed mode** directly from the command line without modifying the `playwright.config.js`. You can use the `--headed` flag like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx playwright test --headed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will override the `headless: true` setting in the configuration file and run the tests in a headed browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Run Specific Browser in Headed Mode**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run tests in a specific browser (for example, Firefox) in headed mode, you can specify both the `--project` and `--headed` flags like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npx playwright test --project=firefox --headed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This runs tests in **Firefox** in headed mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Changes:\n",
    "- **In `playwright.config.js`**: Set `headless: false` under `use` to ensure all browsers run in headed mode.\n",
    "- **From Command Line**: Use the `--headed` flag to run in headed mode, overriding the config.\n",

    "## **Locators**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Playwright, **locators** are a way to identify and interact with elements on a webpage. They provide a high-level API for selecting elements, making it easier and more reliable than using traditional selectors directly. Locators help ensure that interactions happen with the correct elements, even as the page or elements change dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Playwright Locators\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Auto-waiting**: Locators automatically wait for elements to be ready (e.g., visible, attached to the DOM, not moving).\n",
    "2. **Retry-ability**: If an action (like clicking or filling text) fails, locators will retry until the action succeeds or a timeout is reached.\n",
    "3. **High-level API**: Locators support several powerful methods like `click`, `fill`, `check`, `hover`, etc., which simplifies element interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Locators\n",
    "\n",
    "You create locators using the `page.locator(selector)` method, where `selector` is any CSS, XPath, or Playwright-specific selector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const locator = page.locator('button.submit');\n",
    "await locator.click();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `page.locator('button.submit')` creates a locator for a button with the class `submit`, and `await locator.click()` clicks on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Locator Selectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Playwright provides various types of selectors for different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CSS Selectors**:\n",
    "   - Use standard CSS selectors like `.class`, `#id`, or `tagname`.\n",
    "   - Example: `page.locator('button.submit')`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Selectors**:\n",
    "   - Locate elements by text content. Useful for buttons, links, and elements where text is unique.\n",
    "   - Example: `page.locator('text=\"Submit\"')`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **XPath Selectors**:\n",
    "   - Playwright supports XPath selectors for more complex, structured selections.\n",
    "   - Example: `page.locator('//button[@class=\"submit\"]')`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Role Selectors**:\n",
    "   - Use ARIA roles to select elements, helpful for accessibility and dynamic web apps.\n",
    "   - Example: `page.locator('role=button[name=\"Submit\"]')`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Test Selectors**:\n",
    "   - Use `data-*` attributes, which are commonly used as stable, test-friendly selectors.\n",
    "   - Example: `page.locator('[data-test-id=\"submit-button\"]')`\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Nth Selectors**:\n",
    "   - Select elements by index in a list of matched elements.\n",
    "   - Example: `page.locator('div.item >> nth=2')`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locator Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Locators come with built-in methods for interacting with elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`click()`**:\n",
    "   - Clicks the element.\n",
    "   - Example: `await page.locator('button.submit').click();`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`fill(value)`**:\n",

    "   - Example: `await page.locator('#username').fill('testuser');`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`check()` / `uncheck()`**:\n",

    "const passwordField = page.locator('#password');\n",
    "const submitButton = page.locator('button[type=\"submit\"]');\n",
    "\n",
    "await usernameField.fill('testuser');\n",
    "await passwordField.fill('secret');\n",
    "await submitButton.click();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Select Multiple Items by Text\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const items = page.locator('li.item');\n",
    "await items.nth(0).click();  // Clicks the first item in the list\n",
    "await items.nth(1).click();  // Clicks the second item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Handle Dynamic Content with Auto-wait\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locator Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "You can chain locators for more precise targeting. For example, if you need to target a specific child element within a parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const parent = page.locator('.parent');\n",
    "const child = parent.locator('.child');\n",
    "await child.click();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Locators** in Playwright are high-level selectors that offer a stable and robust way to interact with elements.\n",
    "- **Methods** like `click`, `fill`, `check`, `type`, etc., make it easy to perform actions.\n",
    "- **Selector types** (CSS, XPath, text, data attributes) allow you to find elements in various ways.\n",
    "- **Chaining and auto-waiting** make interactions more reliable and easier to use, especially with dynamic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Locators are central to working effectively in Playwright because they handle much of the complexity involved with interacting with the DOM directly. Let me know if you want more specific examples or further details on locators!\n",

    "### **textcontent**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Playwright, `textContent()` is a method used to retrieve the **text content** of a specific element on a page. It captures all the text within an element, including any nested text, similar to what you'd get from the `innerText` or `textContent` properties in the browser's JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use `textContent()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `textContent()` method can be used with a **locator** to get the text from an element. You typically use `await` with it, as it's an asynchronous operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const text = await page.locator('selector').textContent();\n",
    "console.log(text);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `selector` is the CSS, text, or other selector to locate the element.\n",
    "- `text` is the variable where the extracted text content is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Get Text from an Element\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have an HTML structure like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h1 class=\"title\">Welcome to Playwright!</h1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get the text content of the `h1` element like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const titleText = await page.locator('h1.title').textContent();\n",
    "console.log(titleText); // Output: \"Welcome to Playwright!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Get Text from Nested Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "If the text is within nested elements, `textContent()` will retrieve all the text inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"content\">\n",
    "  <p>Hello, <span>World!</span></p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const contentText = await page.locator('.content').textContent();\n",
    "console.log(contentText); // Output: \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Handling Null Values\n",
    "\n",
    "If the element is not found or does not contain any text, `textContent()` will return `null`. It’s a good idea to handle this in your code to avoid errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const text = await page.locator('.non-existent-element').textContent();\n",
    "if (text !== null) {\n",
    "  console.log(text);\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "  console.log('Element not found or contains no text.');\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use `textContent()` vs. `innerText`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`textContent()`**: Gets all text within the element, including hidden text (text that is in the DOM but may be hidden via CSS).\n",
    "- **`innerText()`**: Gets only the visible text within the element (text that would be displayed on the screen).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario: Asserting Text\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `textContent()` to verify if an element contains the expected text in a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const headerText = await page.locator('h1').textContent();\n",
    "expect(headerText).toBe('Welcome to Playwright!');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`textContent()`** retrieves all text within an element, including nested elements and hidden text.\n",
    "- It’s useful for verifying text content in tests or grabbing text for further use in your scripts.\n",

    "## **Playwright's Wait Mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "Playwright's wait mechanism is a powerful feature that helps ensure that tests only interact with elements when they are ready, preventing flaky tests caused by timing issues. It automatically handles many waiting scenarios with **auto-waiting** and **retry-ability** for common actions like clicking, typing, and asserting. Here’s how the different types of waiting work in Playwright:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Auto-Waiting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Playwright automatically waits for elements to meet certain conditions before performing actions on them. This means that Playwright will pause until:\n",
    "   - The element is **attached to the DOM** (i.e., it exists).\n",
    "   - The element is **visible** (unless explicitly targeting hidden elements).\n",
    "   - The element is **stable** (i.e., not actively animating or moving).\n",
    "\n",
    "This auto-waiting mechanism applies to actions like `click()`, `fill()`, `type()`, and assertions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Auto-Waiting\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "await page.locator('button#submit').click();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Playwright will wait until the `button#submit` is available and stable before clicking, so you don’t have to write additional code for waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Explicit Waiting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit waits are useful when you want to wait for a specific condition or state in the application, and Playwright provides several ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`page.waitForSelector()`**: Waits for an element to appear in the DOM.\n",
    "- **`locator.waitFor()`**: Waits for an element to appear, be visible, hidden, or detached.\n",
    "- **`page.waitForTimeout()`**: Pauses the execution for a specified number of milliseconds (not recommended for production tests, as it may lead to unreliable tests).\n",
    "- **`page.waitForLoadState()`**: Waits for the page to reach a specific load state, like `load`, `domcontentloaded`, or `networkidle`.\n",
    "- **`page.waitForURL()`**: Waits for the page URL to match a specified value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Explicit Waiting\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Wait for an element to appear\n",
    "await page.waitForSelector('#notification');\n",
    "\n",
    "// Wait for a specific text to appear\n",
    "await page.locator('h1').waitFor({ state: 'visible' });\n",
    "\n",
    "// Wait for a URL to change\n",
    "await page.waitForURL('https://example.com/dashboard');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Implicit Waiting with Assertions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions in Playwright automatically wait for a specified condition to be true, meaning you don’t need to add extra waiting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example with Assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Automatically waits until the text appears\n",
    "await expect(page.locator('h1')).toHaveText('Welcome');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `expect(...).toHaveText()` will wait until the `h1` element contains the text \"Welcome\" or until a timeout is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Network Waits**\n",
    "\n",
    "Playwright can also wait for network events, which can be useful for AJAX requests or when waiting for the page to finish loading:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`page.waitForResponse()`**: Waits for a specific network response.\n",
    "- **`page.waitForRequest()`**: Waits for a specific network request to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Waiting for a Network Response\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Wait for a specific response\n",
    "await page.waitForResponse(response => \n",
    "    response.url() === 'https://api.example.com/data' && response.status() === 200\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Custom Waiting Conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex scenarios, you can define custom waiting conditions. This often involves using a loop or recursive function to check for a condition, then calling `await` with a short delay until the condition is met or a timeout is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Custom Wait Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "await page.waitForFunction(() => {\n",
    "  const element = document.querySelector('#status');\n",
    "  return element && element.innerText === 'Ready';\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This waits until an element with `#status` has the text \"Ready\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Global Timeout\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure a **global timeout** in `playwright.config.js` to set how long Playwright should wait for each step, each action, or for the entire test run.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// playwright.config.js\n",
    "module.exports = {\n",
    "  timeout: 30000,  // 30 seconds for each test step\n",
    "  expect: {\n",
    "    timeout: 5000,  // 5 seconds for assertions\n",
    "  },\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Waiting Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Auto-Waiting**: Automatically waits for elements to be stable, attached, and visible.\n",
    "- **Explicit Waiting**: Use `waitForSelector`, `waitForLoadState`, and `waitForURL` for precise control.\n",
    "- **Assertions**: Automatically wait for conditions to be met.\n",
    "- **Network Waits**: Waits for network requests or responses.\n",
    "- **Custom Waits**: Allows custom conditions with `waitForFunction`.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **`textContent()` and `allTextContents()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Playwright, both `textContent()` and `allTextContents()` are used to retrieve text from elements, but they differ in **usage** and how they interact with **Playwright’s wait mechanisms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of each method and how it interacts with the waiting mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`textContent()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Retrieves the text content of a **single element** identified by a locator.\n",
    "- **Auto-Waiting**: When you use `textContent()` with a locator, Playwright will **automatically wait** for the element to:\n",
    "  - Exist in the DOM.\n",
    "  - Be visible (if visibility checks are in place).\n",
    "  - Be stable (not actively animating).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This auto-waiting ensures that `textContent()` only retrieves text when the element is ready, avoiding common timing issues.\n",
    "- **Example Usage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  const text = await page.locator('.header').textContent();\n",
    "  console.log(text); // Outputs the text of the .header element\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here, Playwright waits until `.header` exists and is ready to be interacted with before extracting the text content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Ideal when you need the text from a specific element on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`allTextContents()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Retrieves the text content of **all matching elements** for a given locator in an array format.\n",
    "- **Auto-Waiting**: With `allTextContents()`, Playwright waits for **at least one matching element** to appear in the DOM. However, it **does not wait for each individual element** to be visible or stable, as it retrieves text content from all elements in the selection set as they are.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This means `allTextContents()` might pull text from both **visible and hidden elements** in the matched list.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Example Usage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  const texts = await page.locator('.item').allTextContents();\n",
    "  console.log(texts); // Outputs an array of text content for all .item elements\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here, Playwright waits for at least one `.item` element to exist in the DOM before retrieving the text content from all matched elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Useful when you want to get the text from multiple elements simultaneously (e.g., all items in a list or menu).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Summary\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Handling dropdowns in Playwright involves interacting with `<select>` elements or other custom dropdowns that may be implemented using `<div>`, `<ul>`, or similar HTML structures. Here are the main techniques for both types:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Standard HTML `<select>` Dropdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "For standard dropdowns with `<select>` tags, Playwright provides the `selectOption()` method, which allows you to select an option by its **value**, **label**, or **index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax for `selectOption()`\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "await page.locator('select#dropdown').selectOption('optionValue');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ways to Select Options\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **By Value**:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   await page.locator('select#dropdown').selectOption({ value: 'optionValue' });\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **By Label (Visible Text)**:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   await page.locator('select#dropdown').selectOption({ label: 'Option Text' });\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **By Index**:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   await page.locator('select#dropdown').selectOption({ index: 2 });\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "For a dropdown like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<select id=\"fruits\">\n",
    "  <option value=\"apple\">Apple</option>\n",
    "  <option value=\"banana\">Banana</option>\n",

    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "await page.locator('#fruits').selectOption({ label: 'Banana' });\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Custom Dropdowns (Non-`<select>` Elements)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom dropdowns are often built using `<div>`, `<ul>`, or similar elements instead of `<select>`. These require a combination of **click actions** and **locators** to interact with the dropdown and select an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Handle Custom Dropdowns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the Dropdown**: Click on the element that triggers the dropdown to open.\n",

    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   await page.locator('.dropdown-option:has-text(\"Option Text\")').click();\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "  </ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",

    "```javascript\n",
    "await page.locator('.dropdown-trigger').click(); // Opens the dropdown\n",
    "await page.locator('.dropdown-option:has-text(\"Option 2\")').click(); // Selects the option\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Waiting for Dropdown Options to Appear\n",
    "\n",
    "Some dropdowns load options dynamically or have animations. You may need to wait for the options to appear:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "await page.locator('.dropdown-trigger').click();\n",
    "await page.locator('.dropdown-option:has-text(\"Option 2\")').waitFor({ state: 'visible' });\n",

    "## **When to use `await` and when not to**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Playwright (and JavaScript/Node.js in general), `await` is used with asynchronous functions to **pause the code execution until the Promise resolves**. This helps ensure operations complete in the correct order, especially when interacting with the DOM, waiting for network responses, or performing time-sensitive actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown to clarify when to use `await` and when not to:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Use `await` with Asynchronous Operations (Promises)**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use `await` whenever you're working with functions that return Promises. In Playwright, most API actions are asynchronous, so they return a Promise. If you don’t `await` these functions, your code might proceed before the action completes, leading to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of When to Use `await`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Page interactions** like clicking, typing, and waiting for elements.\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  await page.click('#submit-button'); // Waits until the click action completes\n",
    "  await page.fill('#username', 'exampleUser'); // Waits until text is filled\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Navigation** and **network requests**.\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  await page.goto('https://example.com'); // Waits until the page loads\n",
    "  const response = await page.waitForResponse('https://example.com/api'); // Waits for a specific network request to complete\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assertions** that depend on element states, like visibility.\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  await expect(page.locator('#welcome-message')).toBeVisible(); // Waits until the element is visible\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `await` here ensures Playwright waits for these actions to complete, allowing for smoother and more predictable test flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **When Not to Use `await`**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are situations where using `await` is unnecessary or could even be counterproductive. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Synchronous Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **regular (synchronous) JavaScript code**, such as variable declarations, calculations, and simple conditional statements, `await` is not required because these actions do not return Promises.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  const name = 'exampleUser'; // No await needed\n",
    "  const isEnabled = name.length > 0; // No await needed\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **When You Want Parallel Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Independent Actions**: If you want multiple actions to occur simultaneously rather than waiting for one to finish before starting the next, do not use `await` for each action. Instead, initiate the Promises and then `await` them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  const promise1 = page.click('#button1'); // Starts clicking without awaiting\n",
    "  const promise2 = page.click('#button2'); // Starts another click simultaneously\n",
    "  await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]); // Waits until both clicks are done\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Error Handling and Debugging**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using `await` with certain functions unnecessarily can make debugging harder if it’s not clear what part of the code is causing the delay. When in doubt, avoid using `await` on functions that aren’t expected to return Promises.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary: General Rules of Thumb\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use `await`** for:\n",
    "   - **Playwright actions** (e.g., `page.click()`, `page.fill()`, `locator.isVisible()`)\n",
    "   - **Network requests** or anything dependent on an external source’s response.\n",
    "   - **Timers or wait functions** (e.g., `page.waitForTimeout()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Don’t use `await`** for:\n",
    "   - **Synchronous JavaScript** operations.\n",
    "   - Actions intended to run **in parallel**.\n",

    "## **Validate an element's Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Playwright, you can validate an element's attributes by using `getAttribute()` to retrieve the attribute value and then performing assertions or checks on it. Here’s how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Basic Syntax for Validating Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the attribute value of an element, use `getAttribute(attributeName)` on a locator. This returns the value of the specified attribute, which you can then validate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Checking a `class` Attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const element = page.locator('#elementId');\n",
    "const className = await element.getAttribute('class');\n",
    "console.log(className); // Prints the class attribute value\n",
    "```\n",

    "You can use this to check if an attribute value meets specific conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Common Validation Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Check if an Element Has a Specific Attribute Value**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to verify if an attribute equals a certain value, you can use a simple condition or assertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const role = await page.locator('#button').getAttribute('role');\n",
    "if (role === 'button') {\n",

    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const locator = page.locator('#elementId');\n",
    "await expect(locator).toHaveAttribute('aria-label', 'Submit');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will check if the `aria-label` attribute of `#elementId` equals `\"Submit\"`. If it doesn't, the test will fail with an appropriate message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Check for the Presence of an Attribute**\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if an attribute exists, you can use `getAttribute()` and verify that the return value is not `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const altText = await page.locator('img#logo').getAttribute('alt');\n",
    "if (altText !== null) {\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. **Handle New Tabs or Child Windows Using `page.waitForEvent('popup')`**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an action on the current page (like clicking a link or button) opens a new tab or window, you can use `page.waitForEvent('popup')` to get a handle on the new page.\n",

    "### 2. **Using `context.on('page')` to Handle New Pages**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you expect a new page to open, you can listen for new page events on the browser context. This is useful when the new page might be triggered by some external action or when multiple pages could open.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "npx playwright test tests/UIBasicstest.spec.js --debug\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is used to run a specific Playwright test file with debugging enabled. Here’s a detailed explanation of each part of the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breakdown of the Command\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`npx playwright`**:\n",
    "   - `npx` is a Node.js package runner that allows you to run binaries or executables that are installed locally within your project or directly from the npm registry.\n",
    "   - `playwright` is the command for the Playwright test runner, which is used to execute tests written for Playwright.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`test`**:\n",
    "   - `test` is the Playwright command that tells it to run tests. When you run `npx playwright test`, Playwright looks for test files in your project (usually in the `tests` directory) and executes them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`tests/UIBasicstest.spec.js`**:\n",
    "   - This part specifies the path to a particular test file (`UIBasicstest.spec.js`) located inside the `tests` folder. By providing this specific path, you tell Playwright to run only this file, not the entire test suite.\n",
    "   - `UIBasicstest.spec.js` is a typical naming convention for Playwright tests, where `.spec.js` denotes a specification file. It generally contains one or more test cases for UI or functional testing of web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`--debug`**:\n",
    "   - The `--debug` flag enables Playwright’s debugging mode.\n",
    "   - In debug mode, Playwright launches the Playwright Inspector, which provides interactive debugging features.\n",
    "   - When `--debug` is enabled, it opens the browser in **headed mode** (so you can see browser actions in real-time), pauses the test at the start, and lets you step through each action using the Inspector.\n",
    "   - This mode also allows you to explore elements, inspect the DOM, try out selectors, and watch actions in slow motion, making it very useful for investigating issues and understanding test failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happens When You Run This Command?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Playwright test runner will open the specified test file (`UIBasicstest.spec.js`) in the Playwright Inspector.\n",
    "- You can control the test’s execution interactively:\n",
    "  - **Step through each action** one by one.\n",
    "  - **Inspect elements** and **locators**.\n",
    "  - **Replay actions** to see if the test works as expected.\n",
    "  - Debug issues in real-time by examining variables or adding more `console.log()` statements.\n",
    "- Once you’re done debugging, you can close the Inspector, and the test will stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case for `--debug`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command is useful when:\n",
    "- You want to troubleshoot a specific test file for failures or unexpected behavior.\n",
    "- You’re developing a new test and want to verify that each step works as expected.\n",
    "- You need to interactively adjust or explore the page, such as refining selectors or understanding page layout changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `--debug` provides complete control over the test flow and helps you identify problems effectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Interacting with the Page**\n",
    "- Perform actions on the page like clicking buttons, typing text, selecting dropdowns, or navigating to new pages.\n",
    "- Codegen will record all these actions and translate them into Playwright code in the script editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Generated Code**\n",
    "The generated script is displayed in the Codegen window. It includes:\n",
    "- **Actions**: Each user interaction is recorded as a Playwright command, such as `page.click`, `page.fill`, or `page.navigate`.\n",
    "- **Selectors**: Playwright automatically chooses the best selectors for the elements you interact with, ensuring reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of generated code:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Features of Codegen**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Script Generation**:\n",
    "   - No need to manually write test scripts; Codegen generates them for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selector Optimization**:\n",
    "   - Codegen intelligently picks robust selectors to minimize test flakiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cross-Language Support**:\n",
    "   - You can generate scripts in various languages like:\n",
    "     - JavaScript\n",

    "## **Chaining Locators in Playwright**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chaining locators in Playwright allows you to interact with specific elements within a broader scope. It simplifies working with complex DOM structures by narrowing down the search for an element step by step, improving readability and reliability of your tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Locator Chaining Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Chaining locators involves creating a locator for a parent element (or a group of elements) and then refining it by specifying child elements or additional criteria. This is done using the `locator()` method, which supports chaining with dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const childLocator = page.locator('parentSelector').locator('childSelector');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`parentSelector`**: Specifies the parent element.\n",
    "2. **`childSelector`**: Specifies the child or a more refined target within the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Locator Chaining?**\n",
    "1. **Improved Specificity**: Focus on elements within a specific context to avoid conflicts with other similar elements.\n",
    "2. **Better Readability**: Reflects a clear hierarchy of elements in the DOM.\n",
    "3. **Reduced Flakiness**: Minimizes the risk of targeting unintended elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Locate a Button Inside a Specific Section**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const section = page.locator('.section-class');\n",
    "const button = section.locator('button:has-text(\"Submit\")');\n",
    "await button.click();\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- `section` targets a specific section of the page.\n",
    "- The button locator narrows down to a `button` with the text \"Submit\" inside that section.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Locate a Table Row and Click a Link**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const tableRow = page.locator('table#users tbody tr').nth(2);\n",
    "const link = tableRow.locator('a');\n",
    "await link.click();\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The locator `table#users tbody tr` selects all table rows, and `nth(2)` picks the third row.\n",
    "- `locator('a')` finds the link within that specific row.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Handle Nested Elements**\n",
    "Suppose you have nested divs with unique roles:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const parentDiv = page.locator('div[role=\"dialog\"]');\n",
    "const childElement = parentDiv.locator('div[role=\"button\"]');\n",
    "await childElement.click();\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The parent locator targets a dialog element.\n",
    "- The child locator refines the search to a button within the dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tips for Effective Locator Chaining**\n",
    "1. **Start with a Broad Scope**:\n",
    "   - Identify the parent container using a class, ID, or ARIA role.\n",
    "2. **Refine with Child Selectors**:\n",
    "   - Use attributes, tags, or pseudo-selectors to target the child elements.\n",
    "3. **Use Indexing for Multiple Matches**:\n",
    "   - Use `.nth()` to pick specific items when dealing with lists or tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Chaining with Playwright Features**\n",
    "1. **`nth()`**: Selects the nth element from a list.\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   const thirdButton = page.locator('div.buttons').locator('button').nth(2);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`filter()`**: Applies additional filters to narrow down matches.\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   const button = page.locator('div.buttons button').filter({ hasText: 'Save' });\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`first()` and `last()`**: Select the first or last element in a list.\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   const firstButton = page.locator('div.buttons button').first();\n",
    "   const lastButton = page.locator('div.buttons button').last();\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices**\n",
    "- **Avoid Over-Chaining**: While chaining locators improves specificity, avoid unnecessary levels of nesting to keep tests simple and maintainable.\n",
    "- **Use `data-*` Attributes**: Use custom attributes like `data-test-id` for more reliable locators.\n",
    "- **Validate Selectors**: Use the Playwright Inspector or `locator.check()` to verify your selectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Chaining locators is a robust feature in Playwright that allows you to handle complex page structures efficiently. It ensures your tests are precise and adaptable to changes in the DOM.\n",
