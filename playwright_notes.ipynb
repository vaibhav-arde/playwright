    "\n",
    "### 3. **Installing Node.js on Linux**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Option 1: Using NodeSource (Recommended)**\n",
    "     - Open Terminal and install Node.js from the NodeSource repository:\n",
    "       ```bash\n",
    "       # For Node.js 18 (LTS), replace \"18\" with the desired version if needed\n",
    "       curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -\n",
    "       sudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Option 2: Using Package Manager**\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. **Using nvm (Node Version Manager)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you want to manage multiple versions of Node.js, you can use `nvm`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Install nvm**:\n",
    "     - Run this command in Terminal (macOS and Linux) or install [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).\n",
    "       ```bash\n",
    "       curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash\n",
    "       source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc, depending on your shell\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Install Node.js with nvm**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     nvm install 18  # installs Node.js version 18\n",
    "     nvm use 18      # switches to Node.js version 18\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Verify Installation**:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     node -v\n",
    "     npm -v\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "After following the installation steps, `node -v` and `npm -v` should display the installed versions, confirming that Node.js and npm are correctly installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have `.zshrc` as your shell configuration file, you can adjust the command like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash\n",
    "source ~/.zshrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `source ~/.zshrc` command ensures that `nvm` is loaded into your current shell session by reloading the `.zshrc` file, where `nvm` is typically added upon installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This should make `nvm` immediately available for use without needing to restart your terminal.\n",

    "## **Fixtures in Playwright**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Playwright, **fixtures** are a foundational concept that helps manage the setup and teardown of state for your tests. Fixtures can be used to create reusable test environments, such as setting up a browser context, a page, or specific test data, before the tests run. They simplify the test code by eliminating repetitive setup/teardown logic and enable you to control dependencies, which makes tests more maintainable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **What Are Fixtures in Playwright?**\n",
    "Fixtures are objects or states that you need in every test, such as a browser instance or a page object. They handle the setup and teardown needed before and after the tests. In Playwright, fixtures are usually set up using the `test` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Playwright Test Fixtures**\n",
    "Playwright’s `@playwright/test` library provides several built-in fixtures that you can use out of the box. Here are some common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `browser`: Launches a new browser instance.\n",
    "   - `context`: Creates a browser context (similar to an incognito window).\n",
    "   - `page`: Creates a new page within a browser context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playwright manages these built-in fixtures automatically, so you don’t need to configure them manually unless you want custom behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Using Built-in Fixtures**\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a fixture in your tests, import `test` and `expect` from `@playwright/test`. The `test` function provides the fixtures you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// example.spec.js\n",
    "import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n",
    "\n",
    "test('basic test with page fixture', async ({ page }) => {\n",
    "  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n",
    "  const title = await page.title();\n",
    "  expect(title).toBe('Example Domain');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `{ page }` fixture is automatically provided to the test by Playwright.\n",
    "- The test navigates to a webpage and verifies its title.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Custom Fixtures**\n",
    "If you need custom fixtures, you can define them using the `test.extend` method. This is useful for setting up database connections, authentication, or any custom resources your tests require.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Creating a Custom Fixture\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how to set up a custom fixture for an authenticated state:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import { test as baseTest } from '@playwright/test';\n",
    "\n",
    "// Extend the base test with a custom fixture\n",
    "const test = baseTest.extend({\n",
    "  authPage: async ({ page }, use) => {\n",
    "    // Perform login actions\n",
    "    await page.goto('https://example.com/login');\n",
    "    await page.fill('#username', 'testuser');\n",
    "    await page.fill('#password', 'password');\n",
    "    await page.click('button[type=\"submit\"]');\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Wait for navigation or other indication of a successful login\n",
    "    await page.waitForSelector('text=Welcome');\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Pass the authenticated page to the test\n",
    "    await use(page);\n",
    "  },\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "export { test };\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage of the custom `authPage` fixture in a test\n",
    "test('test with custom authPage fixture', async ({ authPage }) => {\n",
    "  await authPage.goto('https://example.com/dashboard');\n",
    "  const welcomeText = await authPage.textContent('h1');\n",
    "  expect(welcomeText).toBe('Welcome to Your Dashboard');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- `authPage` is a custom fixture that provides a logged-in page.\n",
    "- `await use(page);` tells Playwright to clean up this fixture after the test completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Managing Fixture Scope**\n",
    "Fixtures can have different scopes:\n",
    "   - `test`: The fixture is created and torn down with each test. This is the default.\n",
    "   - `worker`: The fixture is created once per worker, which can reduce setup time in large test suites.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify the scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const test = baseTest.extend({\n",
    "  database: [async ({}, use) => {\n",
    "    const db = await setupDatabase();\n",
    "    await use(db);\n",
    "    await db.teardown();\n",
    "  }, { scope: 'worker' }]\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example makes `database` a `worker` scoped fixture, initializing it once per worker thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Teardown for Fixtures**\n",
    "Playwright handles teardown automatically, but if you have custom setup that needs cleanup, use the `use` function to add teardown logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "With these steps, you can use and create custom fixtures to manage state across your tests, making your Playwright tests more efficient and maintainable. Let me know if you'd like more details on any specific part of using fixtures in Playwright!\n",
    "\n",
