    "## **QA Automation Test Architect**\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns, code practices, and debugging skills are crucial for excelling as a **QA Automation Test Architect**, especially when working with JavaScript/TypeScript and Playwright. Let’s delve into each of these in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Design Patterns in QA Automation**\n",
    "Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Using them in test automation helps ensure code modularity, maintainability, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Design Patterns in Test Automation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Page Object Model (POM):**\n",
    "  - **Concept:** Represents a web page or component as a class. Interactions and locators are encapsulated within this class.\n",
    "  - **Benefits:** \n",
    "    - Reduces code duplication.\n",
    "    - Simplifies maintenance when UI changes.\n",
    "    - Encourages reusability across test scripts.\n",
    "  - **Example (Playwright + TypeScript):**\n",
    "    ```typescript\n",
    "    export class LoginPage {\n",
    "        private page;\n",
    "        constructor(page: Page) {\n",
    "            this.page = page;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        usernameField = () => this.page.locator('#username');\n",
    "        passwordField = () => this.page.locator('#password');\n",
    "        loginButton = () => this.page.locator('button[type=\"submit\"]');\n",
    "\n",
    "        async login(username: string, password: string) {\n",
    "            await this.usernameField().fill(username);\n",
    "            await this.passwordField().fill(password);\n",
    "            await this.loginButton().click();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factory Design Pattern:**\n",
    "  - **Concept:** Dynamically creates instances of objects based on input. Useful for test data generation.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```typescript\n",
    "    class UserFactory {\n",
    "        static createUser(type: string): User {\n",
    "            switch (type) {\n",
    "                case 'admin':\n",
    "                    return { username: 'admin', password: 'admin123' };\n",
    "                case 'guest':\n",
    "                    return { username: 'guest', password: 'guest123' };\n",
    "                default:\n",
    "                    throw new Error('Unknown user type');\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    const adminUser = UserFactory.createUser('admin');\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Singleton Pattern:**\n",
    "  - **Concept:** Ensures only one instance of a class exists.\n",
    "  - **Use Case:** Managing global browser or configuration objects.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```typescript\n",
    "    class BrowserManager {\n",
    "        private static instance: BrowserManager;\n",
    "        private constructor() {}\n",
    "\n",
    "        static getInstance(): BrowserManager {\n",
    "            if (!BrowserManager.instance) {\n",
    "                BrowserManager.instance = new BrowserManager();\n",
    "            }\n",
    "            return BrowserManager.instance;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Code Practices**\n",
    "Following best practices ensures clean, maintainable, and scalable test code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Coding Practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No hardcoding:** (any locator, url, username, password, testdata, parameters-passed) - these should come from source: excel/xml/properties file/database...\n",
    "2. **Use of comments and functional documentation comment.**\n",
    "3. **Not making use of inheritance when not required.** - code reusability: Composition, Aggregation, Inheritance, Interfaces and have classes implements Department Students\n",
    "4. **Making good use of interfaces.**\n",
    "5. **Avoid tight code coupling.** Code is dependent on another code --- one fails, other is definitely going to fail. Do loose coupling.\n",
    "6. **Keep code clean and simple, avoid clustering of code.** Not leaving any line between and continuously lot of lines code in a method.\n",
    "7. **Follow KISS(Keep it simple stupid), SOLID, DRY(Dont repeat yourself) principles,**\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOLID:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**S:** substitution principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**O:** Open /Closed Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "**L:** Liskow's substitution principle\n",
    "\n",
    "**I:** Interface segregation\n",
    "\n",
    "**D:** Dependency inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Best Practices:**\n",
    "1. **Adopt TypeScript:**\n",
    "   - TypeScript's static typing improves code readability and reduces runtime errors.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```typescript\n",
    "     async function addNumbers(a: number, b: number): Promise<number> {\n",
    "         return a + b;\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Test Data Management:**\n",
    "   - Keep test data separate from test logic, using JSON or environment files.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```typescript\n",
    "     const testData = require('./testData.json');\n",
    "     console.log(testData.username);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Follow SOLID Principles:**\n",
    "   - Keep your code modular, with a single responsibility per class or method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement Logging:**\n",
    "   - Integrate libraries like `pino` or `winston` for structured logging.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```typescript\n",
    "     import pino from 'pino';\n",
    "     const logger = pino();\n",
    "     logger.info('This is an info message');\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Organize Test Suites:**\n",
    "   - Structure files logically: \n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     ├── tests\n",
    "     │   ├── login.spec.ts\n",
    "     │   ├── signup.spec.ts\n",
    "     ├── pages\n",
    "     │   ├── login.page.ts\n",
    "     │   ├── signup.page.ts\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Parallel Execution:**\n",
    "   - Playwright’s built-in parallelism can speed up test execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Use Assertions Effectively:**\n",
    "   - Leverage libraries like `expect` or `chai` for clear, readable assertions.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```typescript\n",
    "     expect(await page.title()).toBe('Dashboard');\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Debugging Skills**\n",
    "Efficient debugging is critical for resolving issues in automation scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Techniques and Tools:**\n",
    "1. **Use Playwright Debugging Tools:**\n",
    "   - Run tests with debugging enabled:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     npx playwright test --debug\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Add `await page.pause()` in the script to inspect the browser during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Leverage Browser DevTools:**\n",
    "   - Use Playwright's Chromium debugging:\n",
    "     ```typescript\n",
    "     const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false, devtools: true });\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Debug Locators:**\n",
    "   - Use the Playwright inspector to validate locators.\n",
    "   - Command:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     npx playwright codegen\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verbose Logging:**\n",
    "   - Enable detailed logging in Playwright:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     DEBUG=pw:api npx playwright test\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Stack Analysis:**\n",
    "   - Review stack traces for pinpointing errors. Example:\n",
    "     ```typescript\n",
    "     try {\n",
    "         await page.click('#nonexistent');\n",
    "     } catch (error) {\n",
    "         console.error('Error details:', error);\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Unit Test Components:**\n",
    "   - Write unit tests for utility functions or components using `jest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Use Breakpoints:**\n",
    "   - Set breakpoints in VSCode for step-by-step execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Additional Tools:**\n",
    "- **Linters and Formatters:**\n",
    "  - Use ESLint and Prettier to ensure consistent code quality.\n",
    "- **Static Analysis Tools:**\n",
    "  - Tools like `SonarQube` for deeper insights into code quality.\n",
    "- **CI/CD Integration:**\n",
    "  - Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate testing pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering these areas will make you stand out as a QA Automation Test Architect, enabling you to design robust frameworks and tackle complex debugging scenarios with confidence.\n",

    "## **SonarQube**\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving your code based on **SonarQube** results involves addressing various metrics and issues that SonarQube identifies, such as code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, and test coverage gaps. Here’s a detailed guide on how to improve your code after analyzing SonarQube results:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Addressing Code Smells**\n",
    "**Code smells** are areas of code that are suboptimal and might lead to maintenance or readability issues. SonarQube flags such issues to help make the codebase more maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Improve:**\n",
    "- **Refactor Large Methods or Classes:**\n",
    "  - If SonarQube reports **method too long** or **class too large**, break them into smaller, more focused units of code.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```typescript\n",
    "    // Bad: Large function\n",
    "    function processOrder(order) {\n",
    "        validateOrder(order);\n",
    "        applyDiscount(order);\n",
    "        sendNotification(order);\n",
    "        // Other logic...\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Good: Smaller functions\n",
    "    function processOrder(order) {\n",
    "        validateOrder(order);\n",
    "        applyDiscount(order);\n",
    "        sendNotification(order);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    function validateOrder(order) { /* logic */ }\n",
    "    function applyDiscount(order) { /* logic */ }\n",
    "    function sendNotification(order) { /* logic */ }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplify Complex Expressions:**\n",
    "  - If you encounter **complex boolean expressions**, split them into meaningful variables.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```typescript\n",
    "    // Bad: Complex expression\n",
    "    if (a > b && (c > d || e < f)) {\n",
    "        // logic\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Good: Simplified expression\n",
    "    const isValid = a > b && (c > d || e < f);\n",
    "    if (isValid) {\n",
    "        // logic\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remove Dead Code:**\n",
    "  - Identify unused variables or functions (SonarQube flags as **dead code**) and remove them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Fixing Bugs**\n",
    "**Bugs** refer to incorrect behavior or logic flaws that might lead to runtime issues or unexpected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Improve:**\n",
    "- **Null and Undefined Checks:**\n",
    "  - If SonarQube flags potential **null pointer exceptions** or undefined values, add appropriate checks.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```typescript\n",
    "    // Bad: No null check\n",
    "    console.log(user.name);\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Good: Null/undefined check\n",
    "    if (user && user.name) {\n",
    "        console.log(user.name);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handle Edge Cases:**\n",
    "  - Ensure that edge cases, such as empty arrays or unexpected inputs, are handled properly.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```typescript\n",
    "    // Bad: Missing edge case\n",
    "    function sum(arr: number[]): number {\n",
    "        return arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Good: Handles edge case\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **How to Improve:**\n",
    "- **Sanitize User Inputs:**\n",
    "  - Always sanitize user inputs to prevent **SQL injection**, **XSS**, and other vulnerabilities.\n",
    "  - **Example (SQL Injection):**\n",
    "    ```typescript\n",
    "    // Bad: Vulnerable to SQL Injection\n",
    "    const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`;\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Good: Safe query with prepared statements\n",
    "    const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1';\n",
    "    const values = [username];\n",
    "    await db.query(query, values);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use HTTPS:**\n",
    "  - Ensure communication is encrypted by enforcing the use of HTTPS instead of HTTP.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```typescript\n",
    "    // Bad: Insecure communication\n",
    "    fetch('http://example.com/api/data');\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Good: Secure communication\n",
    "    fetch('https://example.com/api/data');\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Libraries with Known Security Patches:**\n",
    "  - Regularly update dependencies to avoid vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Improving Test Coverage**\n",
    "SonarQube measures **test coverage** to ensure that your code is adequately tested. Low coverage might indicate untested parts of your code, leading to potential defects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Improve:**\n",
    "- **Write Unit Tests for Missing Code:**\n",
    "  - If SonarQube reports low test coverage, write unit tests for the missing parts.\n",
    "  - **Example (Playwright + Jest/Chai):**\n",
    "    ```typescript\n",
    "    import { expect } from 'chai';\n",
    "    import { sum } from '../utils';\n",
    "\n",
    "    describe('sum function', () => {\n",
    "        it('should return 0 for an empty array', () => {\n",
    "            expect(sum([])).to.equal(0);\n",
    "        });\n",
    "\n",
    "        it('should return correct sum for an array of numbers', () => {\n",
    "            expect(sum([1, 2, 3])).to.equal(6);\n",
    "        });\n",
    "    });\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increase Coverage for Critical Code Paths:**\n",
    "  - Focus on covering business logic, validation, and error-handling code.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Use Coverage Tools:**\n",
    "  - Use tools like `nyc` or `jest` to generate detailed code coverage reports, and identify untested lines.\n",
    "  - Example: `nyc --reporter=lcov --reporter=text playwright test`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Reduce Code Duplication**\n",
    "SonarQube flags **duplicate code** which makes it harder to maintain and increases the risk of bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Improve:**\n",
    "- **Extract Common Logic:**\n",
    "  - If similar code exists in multiple places, extract it into a reusable function or class.\n",
    "  - **Example:**\n",
    "    ```typescript\n",
    "    // Bad: Duplicate code\n",
    "    function createUser() { /* logic */ }\n",
    "    function updateUser() { /* logic */ }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Good: Reusable helper function\n",
    "    function createOrUpdateUser(action: string) { /* logic */ }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Helper Functions or Utilities:**\n",
    "  - Extract reusable logic into utility files to centralize common operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Adhere to Code Style Guidelines**\n",
    "SonarQube checks if your code follows consistent style guidelines. This includes indentation, variable naming, and other formatting issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Improve:**\n",
    "- **Use a Linter (ESLint/Prettier):**\n",
    "  - Configure and enforce consistent coding styles using **ESLint** and **Prettier**.\n",
    "  - Example `.eslintrc.js`:\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "    module.exports = {\n",
    "        extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended'],\n",
    "        parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',\n",
    "        rules: {\n",
    "            'indent': ['error', 2],\n",
    "            'no-console': 'warn',\n",
    "        },\n",
    "    };\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Auto-format Code:**\n",
    "  - Use **Prettier** to auto-format your code according to your team's coding conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Monitor Cognitive Complexity**\n",
    "**Cognitive complexity** refers to how difficult the code is to understand, and SonarQube reports it if the code is too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Improve:**\n",
    "- **Break Down Complex Logic:**\n",
    "  - Refactor methods with high cognitive complexity into smaller, more understandable units.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Improve Method Naming:**\n",
    "  - Use descriptive names for methods and variables to make the code easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Address Deprecated/Outdated Libraries**\n",
    "If SonarQube detects usage of outdated or deprecated libraries, it's important to update or replace them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Improve:**\n",
    "- **Update Dependencies:**\n",
    "  - Regularly update libraries and frameworks to their latest versions, which can improve performance and security.\n",
    "  - Use `npm outdated` to check for outdated packages.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** in an automation framework helps make the framework modular, scalable, and maintainable. Below is an explanation of how OOP principles—**Inheritance**, **Abstraction**, **Polymorphism**, **Encapsulation**, and **Interfaces**—can be used in an automation framework, with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Encapsulation**\n",
    "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object’s components, which improves security and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Where to Use:**\n",
    "- **Page Object Model (POM):**\n",
    "  Encapsulate locators and actions for a specific page into a class, ensuring locators and methods for interacting with the page are tightly bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "class LoginPage {\n",
    "    // Private locators\n",
    "    private usernameField = 'input#username';\n",
    "    private passwordField = 'input#password';\n",
    "    private loginButton = 'button#login';\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Public methods to interact with the page\n",
    "    public async enterUsername(username: string): Promise<void> {\n",
    "        await page.fill(this.usernameField, username);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public async enterPassword(password: string): Promise<void> {\n",
    "        await page.fill(this.passwordField, password);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public async clickLogin(): Promise<void> {\n",
    "        await page.click(this.loginButton);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefits:**\n",
    "  - Internal implementation (locators) is hidden from the test scripts.\n",
    "  - The test script interacts with the page through well-defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Inheritance**\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent). This promotes reusability and reduces duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Where to Use:**\n",
    "- **Base Classes for Common Functionality:**\n",
    "  Create a base class for shared actions like launching the browser, taking screenshots, or handling waits. Child classes (e.g., `LoginPage`, `HomePage`) can inherit these common methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "// Base class for common functionalities\n",
    "class BasePage {\n",
    "    async navigateTo(url: string): Promise<void> {\n",
    "        await page.goto(url);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    async takeScreenshot(filename: string): Promise<void> {\n",
    "        await page.screenshot({ path: filename });\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Child class inheriting from BasePage\n",
    "class LoginPage extends BasePage {\n",
    "    private usernameField = 'input#username';\n",
    "\n",
    "    async enterUsername(username: string): Promise<void> {\n",
    "        await page.fill(this.usernameField, username);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "const loginPage = new LoginPage();\n",
    "await loginPage.navigateTo('https://example.com');\n",
    "await loginPage.enterUsername('test_user');\n",
    "await loginPage.takeScreenshot('login_page.png');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefits:**\n",
    "  - Common methods (e.g., navigation) are centralized in the base class.\n",
    "  - Avoids code duplication across different page classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Polymorphism**\n",
    "Polymorphism allows methods to take on different forms, enabling the same method to perform different behaviors based on the context. This can be achieved through method overriding or interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Where to Use:**\n",
    "- **Reusable Test Steps Across Pages:**\n",
    "  Define generic actions in the base class and allow child classes to override them for page-specific behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example (Method Overriding):**\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "class BasePage {\n",
    "    async clickButton(selector: string): Promise<void> {\n",
    "        await page.click(selector);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class HomePage extends BasePage {\n",
    "    // Overriding clickButton for custom behavior\n",
    "    async clickButton(selector: string): Promise<void> {\n",
    "        console.log(`Clicking button: ${selector} on Home Page`);\n",
    "        await super.clickButton(selector);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "const homePage = new HomePage();\n",
    "await homePage.clickButton('button#home');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefits:**\n",
    "  - Promotes flexibility and reusability.\n",
    "  - Allows customization of shared methods for specific scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Abstraction**\n",
    "Abstraction focuses on exposing only essential details to the user and hiding unnecessary implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Where to Use:**\n",
    "- **Abstract Base Class for Test Actions:**\n",
    "  Define abstract methods for essential actions (e.g., `login`, `search`) in an abstract base class and implement them in concrete classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "abstract class BaseTest {\n",
    "    abstract setup(): Promise<void>;\n",
    "    abstract teardown(): Promise<void>;\n",
    "\n",
    "    async runTest(): Promise<void> {\n",
    "        await this.setup();\n",
    "        console.log('Executing test...');\n",
    "        await this.teardown();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class LoginTest extends BaseTest {\n",
    "    async setup(): Promise<void> {\n",
    "        console.log('Setting up login test...');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    async teardown(): Promise<void> {\n",
    "        console.log('Tearing down login test...');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "const loginTest = new LoginTest();\n",
    "await loginTest.runTest();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefits:**\n",
    "  - Enforces a common structure for test execution.\n",
    "  - Hides implementation details, ensuring consistency across tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Interfaces**\n",
    "Interfaces define a contract that a class must follow, specifying methods and properties without implementation. They are especially useful in TypeScript for ensuring consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Where to Use:**\n",
    "- **Standardize Test Framework Components:**\n",
    "  Define interfaces for components like reports, drivers, or configuration managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "interface IReportGenerator {\n",
    "    generateReport(data: any): string;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class HTMLReportGenerator implements IReportGenerator {\n",
    "    generateReport(data: any): string {\n",
    "        return `<html><body>${JSON.stringify(data)}</body></html>`;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class JSONReportGenerator implements IReportGenerator {\n",
    "    generateReport(data: any): string {\n",
    "        return JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "const report: IReportGenerator = new JSONReportGenerator();\n",
    "console.log(report.generateReport({ test: 'Test Passed' }));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefits:**\n",
    "  - Ensures all report generators implement the `generateReport` method.\n",
    "  - Promotes modularity and allows switching implementations easily.\n",

    "1. **Modularity**: Code is organized into self-contained components.\n",
    "2. **Reusability**: Common logic is reused, reducing redundancy.\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: Adding new pages or tests requires minimal changes.\n",
    "4. **Maintainability**: Changes in one part of the framework do not impact others.\n",
